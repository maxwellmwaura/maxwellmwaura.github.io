Hey there, I'm Maxwell Mwaura. I'm currently a student at Zetech University, pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology.
I'm a phone and laptop technician which is my part time job, and also learning software development.
Apart from my studies and job I'm an afro dancer and comedian. You can contact me if you need your guests to be entertained at your party.
