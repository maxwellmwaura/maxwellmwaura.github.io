Hey there, I'm Maxwell Mwaura. I'm currently a student at Zetech University, pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology.
I'm a phone and laptop technician which is my part time job, and also learning software developing.
Apart from my studies I'm an afro dancer. You can contact me if you need your guests to be entertained at your party.
